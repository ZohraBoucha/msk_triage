Movement was not possible due to pain. Distal pulses were intact, and he retained full finger and hand movement.\n\nRadiographs confirmed an anterior shoulder dislocation without associated fracture. Under procedural sedation, the shoulder was successfully reduced with immediate relief of pain. Post-reduction imaging confirmed concentric reduction. He was placed in a sling and given analgesia.\n\nHe has been discharged with advice to avoid driving and overhead activity, and referred to fracture clinic for review within 1 week.

The injury occurred whilst he was carrying parcels during work. He presented with immediate and severe wrist pain rated 9/10, gross deformity, and swelling. He reported difficulty moving his fingers and noted altered sensation in the thumb with pallor of the digits.\n\n    He is otherwise fit and well, a smoker, and lives independently. He is right-hand dominant. His work involves frequent manual handling, and he is currently unable to perform any work duties.\n\n    On examination, there was an obvious deformity of the distal forearm with marked tenderness and swelling. Active wrist movement was not possible due to pain. Sensation was reduced in the radial distribution, and the fingers appeared pale though capillary refill was <2 seconds.\n\n    Plain radiographs demonstrated a displaced distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation. Given evidence of neurovascular compromise, he underwent urgent closed reduction under sedation in the emergency department, followed by application of a plaster backslab. Post-reduction assessment confirmed improved neurovascular status.\n\n    He has been discharged with oral analgesia, strict plaster care instructions, and safety-netting advice regarding worsening pain, numbness, or circulatory changes. He will be followed up in the fracture clinic within one week for consideration of definitive fixation. He has been advised to refrain from driving and manual work until further review.\n\n    Yours sincerely,\n    A&E Registrar"

He has noticed partial relief with ibuprofen.\n\n    There are no red flag systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or neurological disturbance. Importantly, his father has ankylosing spondylitis. He is otherwise well, lives with his partner, and continues to work full time, although he finds long meetings and prolonged desk-based work increasingly difficult, which is beginning to impact his professional performance. He also reports disruption to sleep, leaving him fatigued during the day.\n\n    The clinical history is strongly suggestive of inflammatory back pain. At this stage, examination has not been performed, but further investigation is clearly warranted. I would recommend GP review with baseline blood tests including ESR, CRP, and FBC.

She describes an eight-year history of gradually progressive symptoms, which have now become severe and disabling. The pain is focused on the medial aspect of the right knee, described as a deep ache with occasional sharp catching pains, and is frequently associated with swelling and crepitus. She reports regular episodes where the knee feels unstable and gives way, and she finds stairs and prolonged standing particularly difficult. Pain is often present at night and regularly disturbs her sleep.\n\n    She has been appropriately managed conservatively over the years. She has completed two courses of structured physiotherapy and has received intra-articular steroid injections. She uses regular analgesia and has attempted weight loss, but despite these measures her pain has escalated. At present, she is only able to walk for approximately ten minutes at a time before pain forces her to stop, and her activities of daily living are significantly restricted.\n\n    On examination in clinic she walked with an antalgic gait and was using a stick for support. There was a fixed flexion deformity of approximately five degrees, range of movement was from 0 to 90 degrees, and there was marked medial joint line tenderness with obvious crepitus. Neurovascular examination was unremarkable. Radiographs of the right knee confirm advanced tricompartmental osteoarthritis with complete loss of joint space and osteophyte formation.\n\n    Given the severity of her pain, the degree of functional limitation, and the failure of conservative measures, she is an appropriate candidate for surgical intervention. We have discussed total knee arthroplasty in detail, including the risks and expected outcomes. She is motivated to proceed and understands the likely need for postoperative rehabilitation. She will now be optimised pre-operatively, with anaesthetic review and routine pre-assessment arranged.\n\n    Yours sincerely,\n    Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon"

The pain is rated as nine out of ten in severity, worsens with weight-bearing and twisting movements, and is associated with a pronounced limp. He is now reliant on a stick for mobility. His functional capacity is severely impaired; he can no longer shop independently, he has given up gardening, and he struggles with basic household activities.\n\n    He has tried appropriate conservative measures including oral analgesia, physiotherapy, and a single intra-articular steroid injection, all of which have failed to provide sustained relief. He has type 2 diabetes, which is managed with oral medication, and is otherwise well.\n\n    Examination revealed a markedly antalgic gait and global restriction of hip movement, particularly flexion and internal rotation. Pain was reproduced at the extremes of movement. Neurovascular assessment of the limb was normal. Pelvic and hip radiographs demonstrate advanced degenerative changes with joint space obliteration, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis, consistent with end-stage osteoarthritis.\n\n    We discussed the diagnosis and the available treatment options.

His symptoms began after a twisting injury at work, and since then he has experienced sharp medial pain, intermittent swelling, and frequent mechanical locking during which he is unable to fully extend the knee. These episodes occur several times per week, severely restricting his ability to kneel and squat, which is essential for his occupation. He has persisted with six months of structured physiotherapy, along with bracing and analgesia, but continues to experience significant symptoms with little improvement.\n\n    On examination, he had a mild effusion, medial joint line tenderness, and a positive McMurrayâ€™s test. Range of motion was limited to 0â€“100 degrees, with pain on forced flexion. Ligamentous stability was intact and distal neurovascular status was normal. An MRI scan confirmed a complex medial meniscal tear with early degenerative change but preserved joint space.\n\n    Given the persistence of mechanical symptoms and failure of conservative management, he is an appropriate candidate for arthroscopic intervention.
