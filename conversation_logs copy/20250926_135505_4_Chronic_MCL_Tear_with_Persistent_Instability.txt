I hurt my knee playing rugby three months ago and it still feels wobbly on the inside. Physio helped the pain but it’s still unstable, especially when I move sideways.

CONVERSATION:
--------------------
[13:54:27] BOT: Hello, I'm Leo, your musculoskeletal triage assistant. I'm here to help assess your condition and direct you to the most appropriate care. To get started, could you please tell me your full name, age, gender, and date of birth?

[13:54:27] PATIENT: I'm Lisa Sanchez, 38 years old, male, and my date of birth is 16/6/1986. I have i hurt my knee playing rugby three months ago and it still feels wobbly on the inside. physio helped the pain but it’s still unstable, especially when i move sideways.

[13:54:27] BOT: Which side is affected - left or right?

[13:54:30] PATIENT: My knee on the left side is affected. The medial aspect of it specifically feels wobbly when I move sideways.

[13:54:30] BOT: What does the pain feel like? Is it sharp, dull, aching, burning, or something else?

[13:54:32] PATIENT: The pain feels like an ache, about 3/10 at rest. But it gets a lot worse when I move sideways or put stress on the knee - then it's more like a sharp 7/10 pain.

[13:54:32] BOT: Does the pain or feeling spread to any other part of your body?

[13:54:33] PATIENT: The pain or feeling doesn't spread to any other part of my body. It's localized to the knee, specifically the medial aspect on my left side.

[13:54:33] BOT: Do you have any other symptoms like swelling, stiffness, numbness, or weakness?

[13:54:35] PATIENT: The pain or feeling doesn't spread to any other part of my body. It's localized to the knee, specifically the medial aspect on my left side.

However, I do notice some swelling after exertion, and it gets pretty sore when I'm on uneven ground or doing lateral movements. That usually makes the sharp pain worse.

[13:54:35] BOT: Do you experience morning stiffness? If so, how long does it take to loosen up in the morning?

[13:54:37] PATIENT: To be honest, I don't really experience morning stiffness. After 3 months, the pain and instability in my knee have become pretty consistent throughout the day. The only time it seems to change is when I'm doing activities that stress my knee, like lateral movements or uneven ground.

[13:54:37] BOT: Let me ask about specific activities. How much difficulty do you have with: going down stairs, going up stairs, rising from a chair, bending to the floor, getting in/out of a car, putting on socks, getting in/out of the bath, and heavy domestic work?

[13:54:40] PATIENT: "Going down stairs? I'd say it's about 5/10 difficulty - the knee feels a bit wobbly and I have to think carefully about each step. Going up stairs isn't too bad, probably around 2/10 difficulty. Rising from a chair is easy enough, maybe 1/10 difficulty. Bending to the floor? That's a definite no-go for me, at least 9/10 difficulty - it hurts and makes my knee feel unstable. Getting in/out of a car isn't too bad, about 2-3/10 difficulty. Putting on socks is fine, probably around 1/10 difficulty. Getting in/out of the bath? That's not great either, maybe 7-8/10 difficulty - it's hard to balance and makes my knee hurt. And heavy domestic work? Forget it, I'm barely able to do any household chores with this knee, it's at least 9/10 difficulty."

[13:54:40] BOT: What treatments have you tried before? For example, medications, physiotherapy, or other interventions?

[13:54:42] PATIENT: "I've had 6 weeks of physiotherapy after the injury. They helped with pain management and some exercises to improve stability, but I still have issues with lateral movements. I also wore a brace for a while, which gave me some relief, but it's not a long-term solution."

[13:54:42] BOT: Have you had any previous injuries or surgeries to this area? For example, ACL reconstruction, meniscus surgery, knee replacement, or arthroscopy?

[13:54:43] PATIENT: No, I haven't had any previous injuries or surgeries to this area. I've never had an ACL reconstruction, meniscus surgery, knee replacement, or arthroscopy done on either of my knees.

[13:54:43] BOT: When you experience locking or catching, is it more like the joint gets completely stuck and won't move (true locking), or is it more like a brief click or catch that pops and goes?

[13:54:45] PATIENT: Honestly, I don't get complete locking. It's more like a brief catch or click that goes away quickly. When it happens, the knee just feels unstable for a second, but then it settles back down.

[13:54:45] BOT: Is this related to any specific activities like running, marathon training, increased mileage, hill repeats, or prolonged standing?

[13:54:47] PATIENT: To be honest, I haven't been doing any specific activities that would cause this issue. My rugby injury was 3 months ago, and I've just been trying to manage the pain and instability since then. But I have noticed it gets worse with lateral movements or uneven ground, like when I'm playing sports or walking on rough terrain.

[13:54:47] BOT: Have you had any imaging done like X-rays or MRI scans? If so, what were the results?

[13:54:49] PATIENT: Yes, I had an MRI 5 weeks ago. The results showed some medial meniscal damage and a slight tear in the lateral collateral ligament, but no major structural issues with my ACL or PCL. My doctor said it was likely related to the rugby injury.

[13:54:49] BOT: Do you smoke cigarettes or use any tobacco products?

[13:54:50] PATIENT: No, I don't smoke cigarettes or use any tobacco products.

[13:54:50] BOT: To make sure we're not missing anything serious, have you experienced any fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or severe weakness?

[13:54:52] PATIENT: No, I haven't experienced any fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or severe weakness. My symptoms have been mostly related to the knee pain and instability since the rugby injury.

[13:54:52] BOT: Thank you for sharing all the information with me. I now have a complete picture of your situation. A clinical summary with differential diagnosis will be prepared for the clinical team at SWLEOC to direct you to the most appropriate care pathway.

CLINICAL NOTES:
--------------------
Persistent symptomatic valgus instability with complete MCL tear poorly healing despite rehab → consider surgical repair/reconstruction.

EXPANDED CLINIC LETTER:
--------------------
To GP,

A 38-year-old warehouse supervisor (BMI 26) with persistent medial instability 3 months post valgus rugby injury. After 6 weeks of physiotherapy he remains symptomatic; MRI (5 weeks ago) shows complete femoral-side MCL tear with poor healing; other ligaments/menisci intact.

Given ongoing functional valgus instability limiting work and sport, elective surgical reconstruction/repair is appropriate.

Yours sincerely,
Orthopaedic Triage
