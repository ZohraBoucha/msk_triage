CONVERSATION:
--------------------
[13:30:24] BOT: Hello, I'm Leo, your musculoskeletal triage assistant. I'm here to help assess your condition and direct you to the most appropriate care. To get started, could you please tell me your full name, age, gender, and date of birth?

[13:30:24] PATIENT: I'm David White, 31 years old, female, and my date of birth is 20/2/1993. I have the front of my knee hurts when i go up and down stairs. my gp said the scan showed some wear under the kneecap. physio hasn’t helped much yet but i haven’t finished the programme.

[13:30:24] BOT: Which side is affected - left or right?

[13:30:25] PATIENT: It's my right knee that hurts. The pain is in the front.

[13:30:25] BOT: What does the pain feel like? Is it sharp, dull, aching, burning, or something else?

[13:30:27] PATIENT: It feels like an ache. When I rate it out of 10, I'd say it's about a 4 or 5 on a normal day, but when I'm going up and down stairs, it can get up to a 6.

[13:30:27] BOT: Does the pain or feeling spread to any other part of your body?

[13:30:28] PATIENT: The pain doesn't really spread anywhere else. It's mostly localized around the patella, like it's coming from under the kneecap itself.

[13:30:28] BOT: Do you have any other symptoms like swelling, stiffness, numbness, or weakness?

[13:30:30] PATIENT: Yeah, I have some swelling around the knee. It's mild, but it's definitely there, especially after doing activities that aggravate the pain.

[13:30:30] BOT: Are your symptoms constant or do they come and go? Is there any pattern to them?

[13:30:31] PATIENT: They've been gradually getting worse over the past 9 months. It's a bit hard to explain, but I'd say they're more noticeable when I'm doing things that aggravate them, like going up and down stairs or sitting for long periods.

[13:30:31] BOT: Do you experience morning stiffness? If so, how long does it take to loosen up in the morning?

[13:30:33] PATIENT: To be honest, I don't really experience morning stiffness. When I wake up, the pain is there but it's not that bad. It usually takes me about 10-15 minutes to get going and start feeling more comfortable with my knee.

[13:30:33] BOT: How is this problem affecting your daily activities, work, or hobbies?

[13:30:35] PATIENT: It's affecting me in that I have to be careful with stairs at work. I avoid doing too much heavy lifting or bending, especially if it's repetitive, like when I'm restocking shelves. My job is pretty retail-focused, so I try to manage my hours and tasks accordingly.

[13:30:35] BOT: What treatments have you tried before? For example, medications, physiotherapy, or other interventions?

[13:30:36] PATIENT: I've been doing physiotherapy for about 8 weeks now as part of a 12-week course. My GP also referred me for an MRI 3 months ago, which showed some wear under the kneecap. That's all I've done so far.

[13:30:36] BOT: Have you had any previous injuries or surgeries to this area? For example, ACL reconstruction, meniscus surgery, knee replacement, or arthroscopy?

[13:30:38] PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries or significant injuries to this area. My knee has just been getting worse over time, gradually, with no major incidents that I can think of.

[13:30:38] BOT: When you experience locking or catching, is it more like the joint gets completely stuck and won't move (true locking), or is it more like a brief click or catch that pops and goes?

[13:30:40] PATIENT: Honestly, I don't really experience locking or catching. The pain is usually just an ache that gets worse with certain activities like stairs or squats, but it doesn't feel like the joint gets stuck at all.

[13:30:40] BOT: Is this related to any specific activities like running, marathon training, increased mileage, hill repeats, or prolonged standing?

[13:30:41] PATIENT: No, I don't do any specific running or training activities that would cause this problem. My job as a retail worker involves being on my feet for long periods and climbing stairs, which seems to aggravate the pain in my knee.

[13:30:41] BOT: Do you smoke cigarettes or use any tobacco products?

[13:30:43] PATIENT: No, I don't smoke cigarettes or use any tobacco products.

[13:30:43] BOT: Given the nature of your condition, would you be interested in considering surgical treatment if it was recommended by a specialist?

[13:30:44] PATIENT: Honestly, I've been trying to manage with physio so far, but if a specialist said surgery was the best option, I'd definitely consider it. But I'd want to know more about what it entails and if there are any other options first.

[13:30:44] BOT: To make sure we're not missing anything serious, have you experienced any fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or severe weakness?

[13:30:46] PATIENT: No, I haven't experienced any fever or chills. My main symptoms have been localized to the front of my knee, around the patella, with some mild swelling after aggravating activities.

[13:30:46] BOT: Thank you for sharing all the information with me. I now have a complete picture of your situation. A clinical summary with differential diagnosis will be prepared for the clinical team at SWLEOC to direct you to the most appropriate care pathway.

CLINICAL NOTES:
--------------------
Isolated patellofemoral chondral wear without mechanical symptoms; incomplete physiotherapy trial → not for orthopaedic referral.
