CONVERSATION:
--------------------
[13:57:01] BOT: What is your age?

[13:57:01] PATIENT: I'm Joseph Jackson, 28 years old, male, and my date of birth is 14/4/1996. I have severe right wrist pain after fall, 1 hour ago

[13:57:01] BOT: Are your symptoms constant or do they come and go? Is there any pattern to them?

[13:57:02] PATIENT: They're constant. They started right after I fell on my wrist an hour ago and haven't gone away since.

[13:57:02] BOT: What makes your symptoms better or worse?

[13:57:03] PATIENT: Any attempt to move my hand makes it worse. It's like, as soon as I try to even wiggle my fingers, the pain shoots through me again.

[13:57:03] BOT: How is this problem affecting your daily activities, work, or hobbies?

[13:57:05] PATIENT: It's affecting my work big time. I'm a delivery driver, so I need to be able to grip things securely and drive safely. But right now, I can barely even move my fingers, let alone do any of that.

[13:57:05] BOT: Have you tried conservative treatments like physiotherapy, injections, or other non-surgical approaches, and if so, did they help with your symptoms?

[13:57:06] PATIENT: "No, I haven't tried any treatments like physiotherapy or injections. This is the first time I've fallen on my wrist like this, so I'm not sure what else to do."

[13:57:06] BOT: Thank you for sharing all the information with me. I now have a complete picture of your situation. A clinical summary with differential diagnosis will be prepared for the clinical team at SWLEOC to direct you to the most appropriate care pathway.

CLINICAL NOTES:
--------------------
Acute trauma, deformity, severe pain, and neurovascular involvement â†’ immediate A&E required

EXPANDED CLINIC LETTER:
--------------------
To GP,

    Thank you for your referral of this 28-year-old gentleman, a delivery driver, who attended A&E following a fall onto his outstretched right hand earlier today. The injury occurred whilst he was carrying parcels during work. He presented with immediate and severe wrist pain rated 9/10, gross deformity, and swelling. He reported difficulty moving his fingers and noted altered sensation in the thumb with pallor of the digits.

    He is otherwise fit and well, a smoker, and lives independently. He is right-hand dominant. His work involves frequent manual handling, and he is currently unable to perform any work duties.

    On examination, there was an obvious deformity of the distal forearm with marked tenderness and swelling. Active wrist movement was not possible due to pain. Sensation was reduced in the radial distribution, and the fingers appeared pale though capillary refill was <2 seconds.

    Plain radiographs demonstrated a displaced distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation. Given evidence of neurovascular compromise, he underwent urgent closed reduction under sedation in the emergency department, followed by application of a plaster backslab. Post-reduction assessment confirmed improved neurovascular status.

    He has been discharged with oral analgesia, strict plaster care instructions, and safety-netting advice regarding worsening pain, numbness, or circulatory changes. He will be followed up in the fracture clinic within one week for consideration of definitive fixation. He has been advised to refrain from driving and manual work until further review.

    Yours sincerely,
    A&E Registrar
