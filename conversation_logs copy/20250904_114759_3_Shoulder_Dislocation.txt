Left shoulder pain and deformity after rugby tackle, 30 minutes ago

CONVERSATION:
--------------------
[11:47:26] PATIENT: I have left shoulder pain and deformity after rugby tackle, 30 minutes ago

[11:47:27] BOT: Thank you for sharing that with me. When did the symptoms of pain and deformity in your left shoulder first start to develop - was it immediately after the rugby tackle or did they come on gradually over time?

[11:47:27] PATIENT: "Immediately after the tackle. I was still on the ground when I felt it happen, to be honest. It just sort of... gave way or something."

[11:47:28] BOT: That must have been quite a shock for you. Can you describe what the pain in your left shoulder feels like - is it sharp, dull, aching, burning, or something else?

[11:47:30] PATIENT: "Honestly, it feels like a throbbing pain. It's hard to describe, but it's like a sharpness that just won't go away. It's really severe, an 8 out of 10 I'd say."

[11:47:30] BOT: That sounds very uncomfortable. Does the feeling of pain and deformity in your left shoulder move or radiate to any other part of your body?

[11:47:32] PATIENT: "Yeah, it does radiate to my upper arm. It feels like the pain is concentrated in my shoulder, but when I try to move my arm, it shoots down into my elbow and forearm."

[11:47:32] BOT: Now, have you noticed any other symptoms occurring at the same time as your left shoulder pain and deformity, such as swelling, stiffness, or numbness in your hand, wrist, or fingers?

[11:47:34] PATIENT: "No, I haven't noticed any swelling or numbness in my hand, wrist, or fingers. To be honest, it's just this throbbing pain and the way my arm feels all wrong - like it's not even attached right."

[11:47:35] BOT: I understand that the symptoms you're experiencing are quite distressing for you. Now, let's talk about the pattern of your symptoms - is the pain and deformity in your left shoulder constant, or does it come and go at all? Is there a particular activity, position, or movement that makes it worse or better?
 
 (Also, please disregard the duplicate message)

[11:47:37] PATIENT: "It's constant since it happened, to be honest. The pain is still throbbing and my arm feels all wrong - like I said, it feels like it's not even attached right. Anything I do with my arm makes it worse, whether it's moving it or trying to lift anything."

[11:47:38] BOT: It sounds like the symptoms are quite persistent for you. You mentioned that anything you do with your arm makes it worse. Are there any specific activities or movements that seem to make the pain and deformity in your left shoulder significantly worse, or is it pretty consistent across all activities?

[11:47:40] PATIENT: "Honestly, it feels like every movement makes it worse. Even just trying to lift my arm or move it slightly is agony. I think anything that puts stress on my shoulder or upper arm makes it feel worse, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly what triggers the worst pain."

[11:47:41] BOT: Let's focus on the pattern of your symptoms a bit more. You mentioned that your pain and deformity are constant since they happened, and any movement with your arm makes them worse. Have you been able to do anything at all to relieve the pain or reduce the feeling of instability in your left shoulder, such as taking medication, applying ice, or resting it?

[11:47:43] PATIENT: "Honestly, I haven't done anything to relieve the pain yet. I've just been sitting here with my arm still, trying to avoid making it worse. To be honest, I'm not even sure if I should move or do anything - I'm a bit worried about making it worse."

[11:47:44] BOT: You're right to be cautious and want to avoid making the situation worse. Given that you mentioned you were involved in a rugby tackle 30 minutes ago, have you had any previous injuries or conditions in your left shoulder or upper arm that might make this incident more significant or potentially related?

[11:47:45] PATIENT: "Actually, no. I'm pretty healthy and haven't had any major injuries to my shoulder or upper arm before. I've had some bumps and bruises from rugby over the years, but nothing serious like this."

[11:47:46] BOT: To make sure we're not missing anything serious, have you experienced any general health symptoms like fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or any new, severe weakness in your legs?

[11:47:48] PATIENT: "No, I haven't experienced any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss. And actually, I'm pretty sure my legs are fine too - I can move around okay, it's just my left arm that's the problem."

[11:47:49] BOT: Have you tried any treatments for your left shoulder pain and deformity before coming to see us, such as seeing a general practitioner (GP), physiotherapy, or receiving treatment from another healthcare professional?

[11:47:51] PATIENT: "No, I haven't tried any treatments yet. I've just been sitting here with my arm still, trying to let it settle down and see if the pain subsides on its own."

[11:47:52] BOT: How is this problem affecting your daily life, work, or hobbies? For example, are you having trouble performing tasks that normally wouldn't be a challenge for you, or are you needing to take regular breaks due to the pain?

[11:47:54] PATIENT: To be honest, it's been pretty tough. I'm a university rugby player, so being able to use my arm is essential for everything we do on the pitch. Since this happened, I've had to sit out of practice today and I'm not sure if I'll be able to play in our game tomorrow, which is really frustrating for me because it's a big match.

[11:47:54] BOT: Thank you for sharing all the information with me. I now have a complete picture of your situation. A summary will be prepared for the clinical team at SWLEOC to direct you to the most appropriate care pathway.
