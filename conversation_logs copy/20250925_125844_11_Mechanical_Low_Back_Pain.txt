CLINICAL NOTES:

No red flags, mechanical onset, no previous physio → refer to physio

EXPANDED CLINIC LETTER:
--------------------
To GP,

    Thank you for referring this 36-year-old warehouse operative who has presented with a four-week history of low back pain following a lifting incident at work. He recalls straining his back whilst carrying a heavy box. Since then, he has had a persistent dull ache across the lumbar region with intermittent sharp exacerbations, rated around six out of ten in severity. Pain is worse with bending, twisting, and lifting, particularly during long shifts, and improves with rest and hot baths.

    He denies any neurological symptoms, radicular pain, bladder or bowel disturbance, or systemic red flag features. He has been taking ibuprofen with partial relief.

    He lives alone and is independent in activities of daily living, though he finds housework such as vacuuming increasingly uncomfortable. At work he has been struggling with heavier manual handling and has needed colleagues’ assistance.

    The presentation is consistent with acute mechanical low back pain without red flag features. This man has not previously engaged with physiotherapy and would benefit from referral to MSK physiotherapy for education, postural training, and a core strengthening programme. He should continue with regular activity within comfort. He has been counselled regarding the importance of seeking urgent review should new neurological symptoms develop.

    Yours sincerely,
    Virtual Triage Team
