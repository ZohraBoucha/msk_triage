Pain is 3/10 at baseline, up to 6/10 with loaded flexion (squats/lunges). Occasional clicking but no true locking. He has not had physiotherapy. Function preserved but training reduced.\n\nExam shows full ROM, mild medial tenderness, no effusion. Likely acute medial meniscus tear. Initial management with physiotherapy is appropriate. Safety-netting re: locking given.\n\nYours sincerely,\nOrthopaedic Triage"
