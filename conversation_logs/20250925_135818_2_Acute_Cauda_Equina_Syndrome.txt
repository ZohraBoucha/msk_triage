EXPANDED CLINIC LETTER:
--------------------
To GP,

    This 49-year-old office worker presented to A&E with acute onset neurological symptoms on a background of intermittent sciatica. She reported worsening bilateral low back pain over 24 hours, associated with perineal numbness and loss of bladder control. She rated the pain as 10/10 and described her legs as heavy and weak, making mobilising difficult.

    She lives with her husband, works full-time at a desk, and has no previous spinal surgery.

    On examination, she had bilateral neurological deficit affecting L5 and S1 myotomes, with weakness in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Saddle anaesthesia and reduced anal tone were demonstrated. Reflexes were diminished but plantar responses were flexor.

    An urgent MRI scan revealed a large central L4/5 disc prolapse compressing the cauda equina. She was admitted under the neurosurgical team and underwent emergency decompression the same evening.

    She is currently recovering post-operatively and will require inpatient rehabilitation. Prognosis has been explained as variable, depending on neurological recovery. She has been counselled extensively on recognising red flag features in the future and safety-netting provided.

    Yours sincerely,
    Neurosurgical Registrar
