Left hip pain, 5 years, worsening

CONVERSATION:
--------------------
[12:43:05] PATIENT: I have left hip pain, 5 years, worsening

[12:43:05] BOT: Thank you for sharing that with me.

Can you tell me approximately when your hip pain first started, was it a sudden onset or did it develop gradually over time?

[12:43:06] PATIENT: To be honest, it's been coming on gradually over time. I think it started about 5 years ago, but at first it was just a bit of stiffness in my left hip. It wasn't too bad, so I just put up with it and thought it would go away, but unfortunately it's got worse and worse since then.

[12:43:07] BOT: That makes sense. Now, can you describe what the symptom feels like? For example, is the pain sharp, dull, aching, or burning in nature?

[12:43:08] PATIENT: To be honest, it's more of a grinding pain. It feels like my hip is just creaking away, you know? It's a bit hard to describe, but it's a dull ache with this sort of grating sensation underneath.

[12:43:09] BOT: Can you tell me if the feeling moves or radiates to any other part of your body, such as your leg, groin area, or lower back?

[12:43:11] PATIENT: The pain does radiate to my thigh and knee. It's like it's all connected, you know? The stiffness and grating sensation seem to be centered in my hip, but it spreads down into my leg.

[12:43:11] BOT: You've mentioned that your symptoms have been worsening over time. Have you noticed any other symptoms occurring at the same time as your hip pain, such as swelling, stiffness, or numbness?

[12:43:13] PATIENT: To be honest, I've noticed that my hip pain is making me stiff in the morning, and it takes me a bit longer to get going. But apart from that, I don't really notice any swelling or numbness around my hip or leg.

[12:43:14] BOT: Is your left hip pain constant throughout the day, or does it come and go? For example, do you find that the pain is worse at certain times of the day or after specific activities?

[12:43:15] PATIENT: To be honest, it's pretty constant, but it gets worse with activity. If I've been sitting or lying down for a bit, I can get up and about okay, but if I try to walk or do something physical, the pain just comes back and gets worse again.

[12:43:16] BOT: Now that you've described your symptoms in more detail, can you tell me if there are any activities, positions, or situations that make your left hip symptom better, such as rest, stretching, or certain exercises?

[12:43:18] PATIENT: "Actually, I do find that if I take regular breaks to rest my hip when I'm doing something physical, it does help to ease the pain. And when I'm sitting or lying down, the pain is usually a bit more manageable too."

[12:43:19] BOT: Now, can you tell me approximately how would you rate your current level of discomfort or pain in this left hip on a scale of 0 to 10?

[12:43:21] PATIENT: To be honest, I'd rate it about 9 out of 10. It's been really bad lately, especially with walking or doing anything physical. The grinding pain is just constant, but at least when I'm sitting or lying down, it's a bit more bearable.

[12:43:21] BOT: You've described your hip pain quite thoroughly. Now, have you experienced any specific events or changes in your life that might be contributing to the worsening of your symptoms over the past 5 years?

[12:43:24] PATIENT: You know, I think my hip pain has just been getting worse with age. My type 2 diabetes hasn't helped, of course - the doctor says it's related to the wear and tear on my joints. But apart from that, I don't think there's been any specific event or change in my life that's contributed to the worsening of my symptoms.

[12:43:24] BOT: Thank you for sharing more about your medical history and potential contributing factors.

To make sure we're not missing anything serious, have you experienced any general health symptoms like fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or any new, severe weakness in your legs?

[12:43:26] PATIENT: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. My diabetes has been managed pretty well, and my doctor says it's just a matter of keeping an eye on it. But to be honest, I'm not feeling too great about my overall health at the moment with this hip pain being so bad.

[12:43:27] BOT: I understand that your hip pain is causing you significant concern.

Can you tell me if you've tried any treatments or sought help for this problem previously? For example, have you seen a doctor, physiotherapist, or orthotist before?

[12:43:29] PATIENT: "Yes, I've tried various treatments. I've seen my GP about it several times, had physiotherapy to try and loosen up my hip, and even had a steroid injection in my hip joint last year. Unfortunately, the steroid injection only provided temporary relief, and my pain has continued to get worse."

[12:43:30] BOT: How is your left hip pain affecting your daily life, including work, sleep, or hobbies? For example, are you having trouble performing daily activities, or are you feeling frustrated about being unable to participate in things you enjoy?

[12:43:33] PATIENT: To be honest, it's been really affecting my daily life. I need to use a stick just to get around, and even then it's painful to walk or do anything physical. It's also making me feel like I'm missing out on things I enjoy, like gardening and shopping with the wife - we can't even go for a simple walk together anymore because of my hip pain.

[12:43:33] BOT: Thank you for sharing all the information with me. I now have a complete picture of your situation. A summary will be prepared for the clinical team at SWLEOC to direct you to the most appropriate care pathway.

CLINICAL SUMMARY
============================================================
**Clinical Summary**
- **Presenting Complaint:** Left hip pain
- **History of Presenting Complaint (SOCRATES):**
    - **Site:** Left hip
    - **Onset:** Gradual over 5 years
    - **Character:** Grinding pain with a dull ache and grating sensation
    - **Radiation:** Radiates to thigh and knee
    - **Associated Symptoms:** Morning stiffness, pain with activity
    - **Timing:** Constant, worsens with activity
    - **Exacerbating/Relieving Factors:** Activity exacerbates; rest eases symptoms
    - **Severity:** 9/10
- **Triage Assessment:**
    - **Mechanism of Injury:** Gradual onset over 5 years
    - **Red Flags:** Presence of type 2 diabetes, potential wear and tear on joints
    - **Previous Treatment:** Physiotherapy, steroid injection in hip joint with temporary relief
    - **Functional Impact:** Significant impact on daily life, including use of a stick for mobility and limitation in activities due to pain

**Triage Recommendation:**
GP / Primary Care

**Justification:** The patient has a long-standing history of left hip pain that has gradually worsened over 5 years. While the presence of type 2 diabetes is a red flag, there are no acute exacerbating factors or neurological symptoms suggesting an urgent need for care. The patient's symptoms have not responded to conservative management (physiotherapy and steroid injection), but they do report improvement with rest, which may indicate a chronic mechanical issue. Given this history and the functional impact of the pain on daily life, referral to primary care is appropriate for further investigation and potential specialist referral if necessary.
