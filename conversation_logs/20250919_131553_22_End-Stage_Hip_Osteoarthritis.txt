Left hip pain, 5 years, worsening

CONVERSATION:
--------------------
[13:15:01] PATIENT: I have left hip pain, 5 years, worsening

[13:15:02] BOT: Over the past five years, has your left hip pain been a constant issue since the beginning, or did it develop gradually?

[13:15:03] PATIENT: To be honest, it was gradual. It started with just a bit of stiffness in the morning, but over time it's gotten worse to the point where I have this grinding pain in my left groin and buttock area.

[13:15:03] BOT: How would you rate your current level of pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being minimal discomfort and 10 being severe?

[13:15:05] PATIENT: To be honest, it's about a 9 out of 10. The pain is really grinding and stiff, especially with activity or when I've been standing for a while. It feels like it's going to get worse if I don't do something about it.

[13:15:05] BOT: You mentioned that the pain affects your groin and buttock area on the left side. Does this pain radiate down to your thigh, leg, or foot?

[13:15:07] PATIENT: Yes, it does. The pain radiates down to my thigh and knee on the left side. It feels like it's connected to everything in that leg, if you know what I mean.

[13:15:07] BOT: It sounds like the pain is quite widespread and affecting multiple areas of your left lower limb. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensations in your left thigh, knee, or leg?

[13:15:09] PATIENT: No, I don't experience any numbness or tingling sensations in my left thigh, knee, or leg. The pain is more of a grinding, stiff feeling that's hard to describe. It's not really numbness or tingling, it's just this constant ache that feels like it's connected to everything in that leg.

[13:15:10] BOT: You've already mentioned the absence of numbness or tingling sensations. Let's move on to another aspect of your symptoms. Have you experienced any weakness in your left hip or leg when trying to lift, bend, or bear weight?

[13:15:12] PATIENT: To be honest, I don't really feel any weakness in my left hip or leg when trying to lift, bend, or bear weight. It's more like the pain just makes it hard for me to move around and do things.

[13:15:12] BOT: Have you noticed that your symptoms worsen at specific times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, after periods of rest, or after certain activities?

[13:15:14] PATIENT: To be honest, it's gotten worse throughout the day. The pain tends to start as a stiffness in the morning, but as I move around and stand for a while, it starts grinding and gets worse with activity. It's especially bad after I've been walking or standing for a bit.

[13:15:15] BOT: You mentioned that your symptoms worsen with activity, particularly after walking or standing for a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your pain when you're engaging in activities like bending, twisting, or heavy lifting?

[13:15:17] PATIENT: "Yes, that's right. The pain does get worse with activities like bending and twisting. In fact, it's especially painful when I try to twist or turn, as it feels like the grinding sensation gets even worse."

[13:15:18] BOT: Does your left hip pain radiate or spread to any other part of your body, such as your lower back, buttocks, or pelvic area?

[13:15:19] PATIENT: To be honest, it's mainly in the groin and buttock area on the left side where I feel the pain. But yeah, it does radiate down to my thigh and knee as well. It feels like the whole leg is affected by this grinding sensation.

[13:15:20] BOT: Have you noticed any swelling or redness around your left hip or groin area?

[13:15:22] PATIENT: "No, I don't notice any swelling or redness around my left hip or groin area. It's just the grinding pain and stiffness that I'm experiencing."

[13:15:23] BOT: You've already mentioned that there's no swelling or redness. Let's move on to another aspect of your symptoms. Have you experienced any triggers or factors that make your left hip pain better or worse? For example, does it help if you rest, ice, or take medication?

[13:15:25] PATIENT: You know, resting does seem to help with the pain. I find that if I take a break and sit down for a bit, it can ease off for a little while. But as soon as I start moving around again or doing something physical, it comes back. And taking medication helps too - my doctor prescribed me some painkillers that really do help reduce the grinding sensation.

[13:15:25] BOT: You mentioned earlier that resting seems to help with your pain. Are there any other activities, exercises, or techniques that you've found to be helpful in managing your left hip pain?

[13:15:28] PATIENT: You know, I've actually been doing some gentle exercises at home to try and loosen up the stiffness in my left hip. My physiotherapist recommended some simple stretches and movements that seem to help a bit with the pain. It's not a cure-all, but it does make a difference when I'm feeling particularly stiff or painful.

[13:15:28] BOT: You mentioned earlier that resting seems to help with your pain. Are there any other activities, exercises, or techniques that you've found to be helpful in managing your left hip pain?

[13:15:31] PATIENT: You know, I've actually been doing some gentle exercises at home to try and loosen up the stiffness in my left hip. My physiotherapist recommended some simple stretches and movements that seem to help a bit with the pain. It's not a cure-all, but it does make a difference when I'm feeling particularly stiff or painful.

[13:15:31] BOT: How long does it take for your symptoms to improve after you've rested or taken medication?

[13:15:33] PATIENT: To be honest, it's difficult to say exactly how long it takes for my symptoms to improve after resting or taking medication. I'd say it usually takes around 30 minutes to an hour for the pain to ease off a bit when I'm sitting down and resting. But as soon as I start moving around again, it comes back pretty quickly.

[13:15:34] BOT: Are you currently experiencing any difficulties with your daily activities, work, or hobbies due to your left hip pain? For example, do you need to modify your usual routine in any way, or have you had to stop doing certain things altogether?

[13:15:37] PATIENT: To be honest, yeah, I've had to modify my routine quite a bit because of the pain. I need to use a stick when I walk or stand for too long, and it's really affecting my ability to do things like shopping or gardening, which I used to enjoy. It's been tough adjusting to this new level of mobility, but I'm trying to find ways to manage the pain so I can still live my life as normally as possible.

[13:15:38] BOT: You've tried a number of treatments for your left hip pain over the past five years, including resting, taking medication, and some gentle exercises recommended by your physiotherapist. Have you tried any other medical treatments or interventions, such as injections, physical therapy, or surgery?

[13:15:40] PATIENT: You know, I did try getting a steroid injection in my left hip about 2 years ago. It didn't really make much of a difference for me, unfortunately. As for surgery, I've been told it's an option, but I haven't made any decisions on that yet.

[13:15:41] BOT: Have you experienced any numbness or tingling sensations in your right side, such as the hip, thigh, knee, or leg?

[13:15:43] PATIENT: No, I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling sensations in my right side. My symptoms are all confined to the left hip, groin, and buttock area, and they don't seem to be radiating or affecting my right leg at all.

[13:15:43] BOT: Thank you for sharing all the information with me. I now have a complete picture of your situation. A clinical summary with differential diagnosis will be prepared for the clinical team at SWLEOC to direct you to the most appropriate care pathway.

CLINICAL NOTES:
--------------------
Severe pain + functional loss + failed conservative care â†’ surgery

EXPANDED CLINIC LETTER:
--------------------
To GP,

    Thank you for referring this 72-year-old retired builder with a five-year history of worsening left hip pain. He describes constant stiffness and deep-seated pain in the groin and buttock, radiating to the thigh and occasionally to the knee. The pain is rated as nine out of ten in severity, worsens with weight-bearing and twisting movements, and is associated with a pronounced limp. He is now reliant on a stick for mobility. His functional capacity is severely impaired; he can no longer shop independently, he has given up gardening, and he struggles with basic household activities.

    He has tried appropriate conservative measures including oral analgesia, physiotherapy, and a single intra-articular steroid injection, all of which have failed to provide sustained relief. He has type 2 diabetes, which is managed with oral medication, and is otherwise well.

    Examination revealed a markedly antalgic gait and global restriction of hip movement, particularly flexion and internal rotation. Pain was reproduced at the extremes of movement. Neurovascular assessment of the limb was normal. Pelvic and hip radiographs demonstrate advanced degenerative changes with joint space obliteration, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis, consistent with end-stage osteoarthritis.

    We discussed the diagnosis and the available treatment options. Given the extent of his pain, disability, and the exhaustion of conservative treatment, he is an appropriate candidate for total hip arthroplasty. We have discussed the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes in detail. He is keen to proceed and understands the rehabilitation required. He will now undergo pre-operative optimisation, including diabetic review and anaesthetic assessment, prior to listing for surgery.

    Yours sincerely,
    Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon
