CONVERSATION:
--------------------
[13:07:15] BOT: Hello, I'm Leo, your musculoskeletal triage assistant. I'm here to help assess your condition and direct you to the most appropriate care. To get started, could you please tell me your full name, age, gender, and date of birth?

[13:07:15] PATIENT: I'm Maria Lewis, 35 years old, male, and my date of birth is 11/7/1989. I have severe lower leg pain after road traffic accident, 1 hour ago

[13:07:15] BOT: Thank you. Now, what brings you here today? Which part of your body is affected (e.g., knee, shoulder, back, hip, etc.)?

[13:07:16] PATIENT: My lower leg's killing me. The pain's in my right shin, it started suddenly when I was hit by another car an hour ago. It's sharp and excruciating, and it radiates down into my foot.

[13:07:16] BOT: Do you have any other symptoms like swelling, stiffness, numbness, or weakness?

[13:07:17] PATIENT: "Honestly, I don't know. I've got severe pain in my right shin, like I said. The paramedics splinted it, but it's still killing me. To be honest, I'm a bit worried about the wound on my leg too."

[13:07:17] BOT: Do you have any other symptoms like swelling, stiffness, numbness, or weakness?

[13:07:19] PATIENT: Honestly, I don't know. I've got severe pain in my right shin, like I said. The paramedics splinted it, but it's still killing me. To be honest, I'm a bit worried about the wound on my leg too. 

(Note: The patient has already mentioned severe pain and an open wound with bone visible, so further questions about symptoms like swelling, stiffness, numbness, or weakness are unlikely to elicit new information)

[13:07:19] BOT: Are your symptoms constant or do they come and go? Is there any pattern to them?

[13:07:21] PATIENT: "Constant. Since I got hit an hour ago, it's been non-stop pain in my right shin. It doesn't change, just gets worse if I move it."

[13:07:21] BOT: On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable, how would you rate your pain?

[13:07:22] PATIENT: My pain's about a 10 out of 10. It's excruciating and constant since the accident an hour ago.

[13:07:22] BOT: How is this problem affecting your daily activities, work, or hobbies?

[13:07:24] PATIENT: It's not affecting much at the moment because I'm still trying to get treatment. As a cyclist, I'm usually pretty active, but right now, I'm just trying to get through this injury.

[13:07:24] BOT: Let me ask about your treatment history in more detail. Have you had any of the following: physiotherapy sessions, steroid injections, or other specialist treatments for this condition?

[13:07:26] PATIENT: To be honest, I haven't had any specialist treatments like steroid injections or physiotherapy sessions for this condition before. As a cyclist, I've had some minor injuries over the years, but nothing major that required treatment beyond basic first aid.

[13:07:26] BOT: Given the nature of your condition, would you be interested in considering surgical treatment if it was recommended by a specialist?

[13:07:27] PATIENT: To be honest, I don't think I'd have much choice if it was recommended by a specialist. I just want to get this sorted out so I can recover and get back on the bike.

[13:07:27] BOT: Given the nature of your condition, would you be interested in considering surgical treatment if it was recommended by a specialist?

CLINICAL NOTES:
--------------------
Open fracture, severe trauma, surgical emergency

EXPANDED CLINIC LETTER:
--------------------
To GP,

This 35-year-old man, a keen cyclist with no significant past medical history, was brought by ambulance following a road traffic accident. He sustained direct trauma to his right leg after being struck by a car whilst cycling.

On arrival to A&E he was haemodynamically stable but in severe distress. Examination revealed an open mid-shaft tibial fracture with gross deformity, bone protrusion, and active bleeding. There was swelling and bruising, but distal pulses were palpable and neurological function was preserved.

Immediate management included IV access, analgesia, IV antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, haemorrhage control with sterile dressing, and splintage. Radiographs demonstrated a comminuted open fracture of the mid-shaft tibia.

He was taken urgently to theatre by the trauma and orthopaedic team for irrigation, debridement, and temporary external fixation. Definitive fixation will be undertaken once soft tissue condition allows. He remains admitted for ongoing care.

Socially, he lives with his partner and works in IT. He will require significant time off work and input from rehabilitation services. He has been counselled on risk of infection, non-union, and long-term functional impact.

Yours sincerely,
Trauma & Orthopaedics Registrar
